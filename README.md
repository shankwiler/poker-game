#Poker Project

As a cumalitive project for our second semester C++ course we designed a simple multiplayer poker game. Though it isn't the most attractive application, the logic is very sound and employs a number of topics learned that semester, including object oriented design and linked lists. The console application is a simple method of displaying the program design, while a larger graphic application was in the works as well.

Kyle focused on the assignValue method of GameHandler, and the comparison between different hands. This accounts for any possible poker hand combination, from a set of doubles to a royal flush.

Sean Cho worked on handling gameplay, players, player information, and the console application.

Ali Babei worked on the graphic application using Allegro. This was very close to being a solid front end to the game design, though a few bugs prevented it from working perfectly.
